slices:
  # iproute2 is a utility package which typically could be split into
  # utility-specific slices. The `bins` slice however brings in all the
  # utilities for cases where iproute2 is used as a dependency for another
  # package (eg. nginx), where we can't easily know which utilities are
  # actually going to be needed.
  bins:
    # Leaving the debconf dependency out as we don't currently need pkg mgmt.
    # Also, debconf is used by the pkg's maintainer scripts, which are handled
    # differently in Chisel.
