slices:
  # TODO: we do not have the arch-independent slices for gcc-13 and binutils
  # yet, so the user needs to install the target-specific ones manually.
  # See: https://github.com/canonical/chisel-releases/issues/761

  # Rust compiler needs the target-specific linker to link the final binary.
  # Depending on the target architecture, it may need a different linker.
  # For example, to use the default toolchain, install the following slices:
  # - gcc-13-$ARCH_gcc-13
  # - binutils-$ARCH_linker
  # - libgcc-13-dev_core
  # where $ARCH is the architecture triplet. (Note that the gcc and binutils
  # slices will also require you to create links to the target-specific gcc and
  # ld binaries.)
