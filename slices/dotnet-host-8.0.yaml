      # Chisel v1.1.0 does not support the `prefer` attribute. This causes a
      # conflic with dotnet-host-9.0_bins which defines the same content paths
      # as this slice.
      # We resolve this limitation by makeing this slice an alias for dotnet-host-9.0_bins.
      # This is perfectly fine as .NET hosts are backwards compatible.
