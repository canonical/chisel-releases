      # This copy is done to avoid Chisel's current handling of conflicts, as
      # it flags a conflict between this slice and .NET8's, even if the two
      # are not being installed at the same time.
      # Override the installed slice using the following commands:
      # ```
      # mv ${rootfs}/usr/lib/dotnet/dotnet9 ${rootfs}/usr/lib/dotnet/dotnet
      # ln -s ../lib/dotnet/dotnet ${rootfs}/usr/bin/dotnet
      # ```
      # TODO: once Chisel can cope with duplicate contents within the same
      # release, this copy can be suppressed
