slices:
  # This slice offers a standard chunk of the ca-certificates package.
  # It contains the default certificates at /usr/share/ca-certificates/mozilla,
  # a certificates bundle at /etc/ssl/certs/ca-certificates.crt and a config
  # file at /etc/ca-certificates.conf.

  # This slice only contains the certificates bundle at /etc/ssl/certs/ca-certificates.crt.
  # To keep the individual certificates at /usr/share/ca-certificates/mozilla/ or the

  # Please note that the mutation script (partially) mimics the deb's maintainer
  # scripts to generate the certificates bundle.
  data-no-certs:
    essential:
      # This adds the symlink at `etc/ssl/certs.pem` for OpenSSL to look up the
      # bundled certificate file. See `openssl_data` for details.
