  # NOTE: Rust compiler needs the target-specific linker to link the final
  #       binary. The default toolchain included here is using gcc and binutils,
  #       which are already included in the gcc_gcc essential.
  #       Rust calls `cc` to link the final binary, so you will need to create
  #       the symlink for that to work:
  #       ls -s gcc /usr/bin/cc
