  # The libpam-runtime package caries nothing that can actually be directly
  # used by other packages. The files that are used, are generated by "usr/sbin/pam-auth-update"
  # based on input from /usr/share/pam-configs/* and outputs five different files into
  # /etc/pam.d/common-{account,auth,password,session,session-non-interactive}. The contents
  # of those are directly derived from the contents of the pam-configs.
  # Other packages can carry these pam-configs too, and usually invoke pam-auth-update
  # to regenerate these five files mentioned.
  # pam-config and pam-defaults slices are only used for generation, and are useless
  # for anything else.

  # Applications that need libpam for now should just rely on the config and var slices for now -
  # until appropriate solution for emulating what pam-auth-update can do (or maybe something else).
